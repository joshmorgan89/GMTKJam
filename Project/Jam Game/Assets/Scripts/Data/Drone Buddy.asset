  description: "Drone Buddy:<br>Holds unused rooms/asteroids independent of the ship.
    Drone buddy can only hold 4 rooms on his cardinal points, but doesn\u2019t need
    to be attached to the ship. Solar Sail has more storage space but is affected
    by weather and needs to be anchored to the rear outside the ship. "
